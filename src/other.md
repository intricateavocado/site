### some fun info
`(1-(((197-h-w)!*(197-h-4)!)/((197-h)!*(197-h-w-4)!)))*100,h=9,w=5`
is the formula to calculate the chance of getting a skin you want in your shop; where h = the number of skins you own, and w = the number of skins you want.
you can solve it using [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)!
