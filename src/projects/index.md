# upcoming/planned

## databases
I'm working with a few databases right now using SQLite and hoping to develop a web app for them

## [garden-monitor](/projects/garden-monitor){.link-default}
the idea is powered by a Raspberry Pi, in a custom outdoor/waterproof enclosure, connected to a variety of sensors (temp, humidity, soil temp, soil moisture, UV light, etc). at the moment, the hold up is powering the device (solar?) and data storage. ideally, the device would collect sensor data multiple times per day, storing it, and then can be later analyzed to see how different plants performed in different parts of the season.

## [coxbox](/projects/coxbox){.link-default}
the market for rowing cox boxes is entirely controlled by NK Sports, and the price of these (relatively simple) devices is extremely high; $689 at the time of writing. all that, for a waterproof box that indicates stroke rate, time, and split. oh, and for GPS, you need to put down an additional $200. absurd.

## [randomfact](/projects/randfact){.link-default}
discord py bot for a friend, might make it public, sends a random daily fact w/ customizable scheduling, history, and more commands

## [ergapp](/projects/ergapp){.link-default}
another rowing one, this one is just a concept atm, but the idea is: super simple, take a picture of your erg workout screen, and use text recognition to scan it and upload to C2 Logbook.
